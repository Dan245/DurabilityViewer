If I have time I'll try and update this to 1.19.4

# DurabilityViewer

This is another mod that shows your item durabilities as I couldn't find one that had everything I wanted.

 

Differences to other similar mods are:

 

- Show item durability numbers in color (green/white/yellow/red) depending on items state

- Items that are at almost 100% show damage, not durability. For example, your diamond pick that was used 5 times will show -5, not 1556. Great when you're using the mending enchantment to fix your stuff and don't know the exact number you want to reach

- Also show number of empty inventory slots; know at a glance if you can continue mining or should return to your chest

- Play a warning sound when your item is about to break; stop losing your Efficiency V pick to not looking at the GUI

To make sure the mod doesn't slow down your minecraft,
